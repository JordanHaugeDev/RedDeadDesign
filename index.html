      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Red Dead Redemption II is an open-world western action-adventure game
        developed by Rockstar Games, released in October of 2018. The game takes
        place in the fictionalized Wild West of 1899. The world is changing
        rapidly, almost too fast for the group the game follows. They are the
        Van Der Linde Gang, a group of outlaws struggling to survive in an
        ever-changing country and sticking firmly to their outlaw way of life.
        As the world around them becomes more civilized and law enforcement
        tightens its grip, the gang begins to face more turmoil than ever. The
        protagonist, Arthur Morgan, has to decide what kind of man he’s going to
        be as his family falls apart around him and his health quickly declines.

        2018 was an incredible year for gaming, but something about RDR2 stood
        out amongst the rest, despite having steep competition from game of the
        year winner God of War and a plethora of other titles. Besides being a
        visually stunning sequel to the critically acclaimed Red Dead Redemption
        (2010), the game had something to it, there was a buzz around it. I
        haven’t fully shaken it. I still make references to the game 6 years
        later with friends and family. Having finished my 3rd playthrough just a
        few months ago, I have firmly placed the game in my top 3 of all time.
        It’s the balance the game achieves that does it for me. Sure, there are
        other games with better combat, better traversal, a better original
        score, a better this, and a better that, but where RDR2 excels for me is
        the harmony of all its parts. Every aspect of the game delivers and
        works together as a part of a whole. The world is filled with meticulous
        detail and diverse environments. The characters are complex and clearly
        defined. The story is filled with themes of loyalty, betrayal, and
        redemption. The gameplay mechanics are balanced and robust. The
        performances are heartfelt and lived in. It all comes together to create
        a living, breathing, immersive world that marries its components
        seamlessly.

      <h2>The Sandbox</h2>
      <h4>
        Take a look at the RDR2 interactive map:

      </h4>

      <p>
        While RDR2 offers an excellent story for players to work their way
        through, its open world is equally impressive. After a nearly three-hour
        story prologue, the player is finally cut loose, free to explore the
        open world of this fictionalized version of the wild west. The
        environments range from snow ridden mountain tops, to dense forests, to
        wide open pastures, and sizzling deserts. The world has a full day night
        cycle and dynamic weather events. The animals graze and hunt for food.
        Towns are bustling with civilians going about their days, each person
        can be interacted with in a positive or negative way. Buildings and
        houses are being built and strangers in need are in every corner of the
        map. This world gives the player the sense that if you just left it
        alone, it would live on uninterrupted. It feels alive and it’s
        incredibly immersive.

        The open-world design and player agency foster emergent gameplay
        experiences. Players can stray from the main story and stumble upon
        unexpected events, like a shootout between rival gangs or a lone
        traveler needing help. These unscripted moments contribute to the
        feeling of a living world and provide unique experiences for each
        player. Domsch talks about Timed Events and the Intradiegetic Clock.
        RDR2 takes full advantage of the in-game time, having many events only
        available at certain times of day. Missions with the mayor of Saint
        Denis are only available at night while other stranger missions are only
        available during the day. Many of the main quests can be done at any
        time of day and will reflect as such during the mission and cutscenes.
      </p>
      <p>
        A core tenet of Piccuci's sandbox philosophy is that player agency
        fosters emergent storytelling. The idea of motivating players to explore
        the world and uncover new secrets or characters is the backbone of the
        game's world design. This lets the player create their own stories out
        in the world and lets them tackle objectives in a nonlinear fashion. The
        freedom allowed in the sandbox is vast. Most non-player characters are
        able to be interacted with by either greeting or antagonizing. Nearly
        all non-player characters can be killed, including some of the strangers
        who give missions like William the herb enthusiast. Strangers in need
        can be found during travel, whether it be a man caught in a bear trap, a
        woman whose horse collapsed, or a stagecoach being robbed by a rival
        gang. Giving players this much freedom allows them to choose what kind
        of outlaw they want to be, whether they want to be friendly or want to
        feed civilians to gators, it's up to them. Sandbox games like RDR2, "are
        designed to maximize the paidia type of play and provide an interacive
        environment where players can exercise creativity and craft individual
        stories which maintain a sense of cohesiveness within the greater
        narrative framework" (Piccuci 110).
      </p>
      <img class="right" src="./assets/open world.jpg" alt="" />
      <p>
        Rival gangs are everywhere. The O'Driscolls, Murfrees, Laramies,
        Skinners, Lemoyne Raiders, etc, can be found setting up camp and
        ambushing civilians throughout the open world. They even search and
        ambush the main camp if the player isn't careful. The non-scripted
        nature of these moments can lead to genuine surprises and unique
        experiences for each player. That being said, these events are not
        without logic. Each gang has their territory, for example you wont run
        into the Skinners unless you are out West near BlackWater and are
        unlikely to run into Lemoyne Raiders unless out East just outside Saint
        Denis. Knowing the territory means knowing more of what to expect the
        world to throw at you.
      </p>

      <p>
        The pacing and delivery of the narratives in the sandbox are up to the
        player, "unlike the Pre-established structure, here we are presented
        with a higher degree of nonlinearity combined with the frequent presence
        of side-stories and/or multiple story branches. While an overarching pre
        established storyline is still present, more space is given to the
        exploration of the environments and optional retrieval of additional
        story information" (Piccuci 107).

        Players can traverse the vast open world on horseback or by foot. The
        game utilizes a third-person perspective, allowing you to take in the
        scenery and interact with the environment. Players can engage in
        gunfights using a variety of period-appropriate weapons like pistols,
        rifles, and shotguns. A targeting system assists with aiming, but manual
        aiming rewards skill. Dead Eye, a bullet-time mechanic, allows for rapid
        takedowns of multiple enemies. Hand-to-hand combat adds another layer,
        requiring strategy and quick reflexes. The player's horse isn't just a
        mode of transportation, it's also a loyal companion. Bonding with the
        horse through brushing, feeding, and calming increases its
        manueverability, speed, and loyalty. Challenges can be made or
        discovered by the player. The game encourages this through rewards and
        achievements. An example is an achievement for having a bounty of $250
        in every state at the same time. Other challenges like horse challenges
        or gunslinger challenges can lead to rewards that include clothing items
        and pouches. Much of the fun is in setting challenges for yourself, like
        hunting for 3 star pelts or seeing how long you can last in a shootout
        with the law in Saint Denis.
      </p>

        Feedback is given in a number of ways, through hit markers, stamina,
        health, and dead eye cores, as well as the HUD. Hit markers will change
        color based on whether the shot was a critical hit or not and the
        players honor status will be represented through many of their actions.
        The game has a bit of a learning curve for the mechanics; It is not
        uncommon to accidentally shoot a stranger when you were trying to greet
        them. Though with time and practice, mastery of the mechanics can lead
        to incredibly satisfying combat and traversal.

        Mods give way to a plethora of new game modes, features, and emergent
        gameplay. Trainers, weapons, and cosmetic items previously exclusive to
        Red Dead Online have made their way to the single player experience
        through modding. Custom mods allow players to dress up as Clint
        Eastwood, John Wick, or even Red Harlow from Red Dead Revolver. With
        mods, the gameplay mechanics can be modified to your heart's content.
        One of my favorites in Undead Nightmare II, a mod that takes inspiration
        from the first game's bonus zombie mode. While the mod doesn't have a
        story, it is a lot of fun to see the world transformed into an
        apocalyptic wasteland and get a glimpse at what could have been if
        Rockstar decided to make a sequel to the highly popular original mode
        from 2010.

        Unlike generic background characters, the NPCs in RDR2 offer a variety
        of interactive possibilities. Players can greet them with a simple
        "Howdy" or engage in deeper conversations that reveal hidden stories or
        lead to side quests. These interactions aren't limited to dialogue.
        Players can offer help to those in need, gamble in saloons, or even rob
        unsuspecting townsfolk (though the consequences will vary depending on
        Arthur's honor rating). This range of interaction makes the world feel
        like it's populated by real people, not pre-programmed NPCs.
      </p>
      <p>
        The game's interactivity extends to the environment itself and the space
        of possibility is enormous. Players can not only admire the scenery, but
        they can interact with it in meaningful ways. Hunting animals for food
        and crafting materials, fishing for relaxation, or simply picking herbs
        for medicine all add to the feeling of inhabiting a living world. These
        interactions are further enhanced by diegetic systems. Brushing and
        feeding your horse isn't just a menu option; it's a process that
        strengthens the bond between player and mount. These details may seem
        small, but they contribute to a more immersive and interactive
        experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        The interaction between player and nature seems to have been a big focus
        in Rockstar's development process. The wildlife responds realistically
        to the player's actions and seems to have a functioning ecosystem. While
        exploration, hunting, and combat are core aspects of the game,
        interactivity extends beyond them. Players can engage in a variety of
        mini-games, from poker and blackjack in saloons to five finger filet and
        challenges with other characters. These activities offer a welcome break
        from the main story and further enrich the world-building and
        characters.
      </p>
      <img class="right" src="./assets/John and Arthur.png" alt="" />
      <p>
        Much of the big decisions in the story are examples of Salen and
        Zimmerman's third mode of interactivity, Explicit interactivity. These
        are moments in the story where the cutscene takes a pause to let the
        player reflect on their current decision and react accordingly. This
        interaction is normally through the press of button 1 or button 2, but
        these choices stack up throughout the game and determine what kind of
        man Arthur is. Agency in the game's main story is often a bit limited,
        being a choice between good or bad, (low or high honor). The outcomes to
        these choices are obvious, so a player who wants to lean into the idea
        of Arthur being redeemed will likely always select the choice that gives
        positive honor, making the selection of narrative choices a bit slim.
        But the fact that the game has any agency at all considering the scale
        and depth of the world is incredible in itself.

      <h2>Honor</h2>
      <div class="container">
        <div class="column high">
          <h2>high</h2>
          <p>
            A high honor Arthur is seen favorably by the citizens of the Wild
            West. This translates to significant discounts in shops throughout
            the game world. Whether you're looking for new weapons, provisions,
            or stylish clothing, a high honor rating ensures you get a better
            deal. Additionally, certain shops and missions might even be
            inaccessible to low honor outlaws. Maintaining a good reputation
            opens doors literally and metaphorically in the world. High honor
            isn't just about discounts and quests, it can also make the core
            gameplay loop more enjoyable. Helping people and completing
            honorable missions often yield positive emotional rewards.
            Witnessing the gratitude of those you've helped can be a satisfying
            experience, adding a layer of purpose to your actions while also
            progressing Arthur's character arc.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="column low">
          <h2>low</h2>
          <p>
            The world rewards the ruthless. Low honor opens doors to lucrative
            opportunities like robbing banks, trains, and unsuspecting
            travelers. These risky endeavors can yield significant financial
            gains, allowing you to acquire better weapons, gear, and horses. Low
            honor also generally increases the amount of loot you find on dead
            bodies, further fueling the outlaw playstyle. The freedom of action
            no matter the consequences is something players often enjoy in
            gaming. Games like Grand Theft Auto or Postal give players an open
            playground to go nuts in. This playstyle can be a refreshing change
            of pace for players looking for a more action-oriented experience.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p class="card">
        The honor system is the game's main way of expressing agency throughout
        the story and the sandbox. The game will react to your choices and
        adjust character interactions and story beats accordingly. While there
        are a number of choices to be made throughout the narrative, Red Dead
        Redemption 2's agency does have limitations. The core narrative arc
        exists, and many mission outcomes are predetermined. However, the
        order/way you approach these missions, the choices you make along the
        way, and the world you interact with, all contribute to a unique and
        memorable experience for each player.

        The Story follows the Van Der Linde gang led by outlaw Dutch Van Der
        Linde. He is a charismatic leader with dreams of living free from rules
        and order with his surrogate gang family. The gang operates under
        Dutch's idealistic vision of "one last score" that will allow them to
        escape the law and live freely. However, as the story progresses, it
        becomes clear that this dream is fading. As the gang faces mounting
        pressure and setbacks, tensions rise. Dutch's leadership becomes
        increasingly erratic and paranoid, straining his relationships with
        Arthur and other members. These internal conflicts threaten to tear the
        gang apart. Arthur struggles with his loyalty to his family and doing
        what's right. Arthur faces his mortality as he struggles with a new
        health diagnosis that puts his life on a countdown. He reflects on his
        past choices and his desire for redemption emerges.

      <p>
        Looking at the story through Schell's lens of the Hero's Journey, Arthur
        goes through many of the steps and can be seen as going from a selfish
        outlaw to a man who just wants to do some good with the time he has
        left. The story follows the classic archetypes, the call to adventure,
        the challenges and temptations, the revelation, transformation,
        atonement, and resolution. The journey begins with the gang in the thick
        of it, and they really never get out of it. A shootout in BlackWater has
        forced the gang into constant moving and hiding. Along his journey
        Arthur meets a number of people who inspire him, including a Native
        American named Rain Falls and a nun named Calderon. As the rift between
        himself and Dutch grows he begins to see things more clearly and his
        transformation begins. He reconciles with his past mistakes and begins
        to make things right in his own way. In the end, his redemption comes
        from trying to make other's lives better rather than his own. Arthur
        discovers the good in himself even if he denies its presence. His
        character arc is one of intrinsic growth motivated by a sudden death
        sentence that gives him clarity. Some may argue he isn't a hero, but the
        game definitely wants you to consider that he can be, especially with
        some of the choices the player can make towards the end. Do you help
        John get back to his family and escape the attack, or do you go back to
        the cave for the stockpile of money? The degree of his heroic nature and
        his redemption is up to the player.

      <h2>Narrative Design</h2>
      <p>
        RDR2 strikes a balance between Piccuci's idea of pre-established
        narrative structure and discovery narrative. The player can weave their
        story between these two narrative delivery methods. Each mission in the
        game more or less has a definitive ending, though the order you tackle
        them is almost entirely up to you. In each act the map is populated with
        multiple quest markers, usually starting with the quest giver's first
        initial. Whether the player wants to do a Dutch mission first or a Sadie
        mission first or any other available mission is entirely up to them.
        When in a mission, the structure is largely linear. Rockstar likely
        focused on a pre-established narrative because they had a specific story
        they wanted the players to experience, rather than creating branching
        paths. Because of this, missions often don't affect other available
        missions, but completing them does normally populate the map with new
        ones.

      <p>
        In many ways the pacing of the game could be considered a slow burn, but
        this only allows the player to become more invested in the story and the
        characters. Spending more time at camp and interacting with the story's
        main characters gives a deeper appreciation to what each character's
        beliefs/values are and what obstacles are in their way. Seeing the group
        as a family makes the story all the more tragic as well as bittersweet.
        It's really a narrative about a family breaking apart in the most
        dramatic of ways.
      </p>
      <p>
        The importance of character cannot be overstated here. Miller says, "One
        of the truly unique aspects of digital characters, as opposed to
        characters created for movies or traditional TV, is that you don’t just
        watch them; you can actually be them. Or, at the very least, you can
        interact with them" (Miller 90). There's something about being in a
        character's shoes that makes you appreciate the situation all the more.
        In a game like The Last of Us, being Joel is far more stressful than
        just watching Joel. Shifting perspectives changes everything. When you
        play as Ellie near the end of The Last of Us I, it's scarier than
        playing as Joel, the sense of vulnerability is increased. The same goes
        for playing Arthur's story rather than just watching it. When you
        experience the diagnosis after playing as him for so long, it feels like
        heartbreaking news and suddenly you realize the game is coming to an
        end, and if you're thoroughly enjoying it like I did, that's bad news.
        Perspective makes all the difference in storytelling.

        Miller asks, "Is it essential to include an oppositional character or
        series of them in every work of digital entertainment?" (Miller 96). The
        simple answer is no, antagonists are not essential, but they are
        compelling. Part of what makes being Arthur so stressful is the amount
        of Antagonists he has to deal with. Not only are there a number of rival
        gangs out to get the Van Der Lindes, but he eventually has to worry
        about his closest friends and family. Dutch slowly becomes the
        antagonist over the course of the narrative and since he is a
        father-figure and a brother to Arthur, it makes it all the more painful.
        Dutch is a complex antagonist because he never really had ill intentions
        towards his family, he just couldn't achieve his dream and the constant
        setbacks as well as head trauma lead to his increasing paranoia and loss
        of control. He brought in all these people that the world rejected and
        created a family. He is the first one to step up when an outsider needs
        help, but his ability to rein himself in dies with Hosea and Molly. He
        is also poisoned by Micah, one of the newest members of the gang who has
        a lack of self control and a faulty moral compass. Micah can be seen as
        the true antagonist of the game because of his shady nature and deep
        betrayal. In many ways he is the one who tears the group apart and the
        game sets him up to be the final conflict of the epilogue.

        Taking on all these challenges and storylines can take the player well
        over 60+ hours; with all the side quests and sandbox activities,
        achieving 100% completion can take well over 120+ hours. The design of
        the narrative is extremely well thought out and carefully crafted. The
        ability the player has to weave in and out of the narrative and control
        the pace of the story makes it one of the greatest open-world action
        adventure narratives to date.

        There are plennty of games with much deeper agency and player choice,
        but where RDR2 lacks in meaningful decision making, it makes up for in
        compelling narrative and a rich open-world. The mechanics are robust and
        the performances are award worthy. Roger Clark, Benjamin Byron Davis,
        Rob Wiethoff, Alex McKenna, Peter Blomquist, and the rest of the
        incredible cast put over 5 years into performance capture/voice work and
        deepened my appreciation for video game performances in a big way. While
        the game has drawbacks as many do, this game is a masterpiece in my
        mind. It finds a way to balance the heart of the story, with a GTA style
        sandbox all while making it feel cohesive.

        If you asked me to show someone who never plays video games an example
        of why the medium is so beloved, this is the one I would show them. The
        visuals alone are breathtaking, but the deeper you look, the more this
        game has to offer. In many ways it almost feels like an adaptation of a
        book and I mean that in the best way possible. I play a lot of games,
        but outside of pure nostalgia, this game has stuck with me in a way many
        haven't. As I said, it isn't the best at any one thing necessarily, but
        the balance it strikes is awe inspiring and I can only imagine the depth
        of the development process.
      </p>
      <p>
        Arthur will stick with me as one of my favorite Protagonists of any
        medium, along with Kratos, Walter White, and Jimmy McGill. There's
        something about flawed characters that resonates with audiences (& me)
        in a deep way. These are characters who make mistakes and often end up
        paying for them in big ways. But these are also characters who seek
        Redemption as well. The idea behind characters like these is that a
        person can change and is the sum of the actions they make going forward,
        not just the ones they made in their past. These stories belong in any
        medium, but I think gaming offers a different perspective and that's
        what excites me about the future of it more than any other medium. Games
        are advancing at an incredible rate and the nature/potential of telling
        great stories is only getting better. Red Dead Redemption II will stand
        out as one of the greatest examples of what the medium can offer and
        will be remembered and played for decades to come.
